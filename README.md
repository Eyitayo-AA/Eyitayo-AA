- 👋 Hi, I’m @Eyitayo-AA - A jack of many trades and habitual researcher.
- 👀 I’m interested in Product Management. Community Optimisation and Web3 most draw my attention.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Product Management and developing a web platform for associations and communities.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything, [anything with feature phones as a focus is an automatic 'YES']. I am an entry level Product Manager and Business Developer with 3 products under my belt, looking to make a jump to the intermediate level. Previous experience at Management level in design and communications.
- 📫 Mail me to discuss strategy and business modelling at adeoyeeyitayo@gmail.com.
